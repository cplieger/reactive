/**
 * Test-only resets for the framework's module-global state.
 *
 * Published as the `@cplieger/reactive/actions/testing` subpath so a suite can return
 * the notifier, api, transport, define, registry and cleanup slots to their
 * unconfigured state between cases; without that, one test's `configure*()`
 * call and its registered actions leak into the next. Import it from test code
 * only: in an application the slots are set once at boot, and clearing them at
 * runtime drops the adapters every dispatch depends on.
